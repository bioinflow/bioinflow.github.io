What?: BioINflow is a utopian experiment of three young researchers. An attempt to make bioinformatics accessible to a heterogeneous public, which includes experts and neophytes. An attempt to share knowledge and opportunities. An attempt to satisfy, first of all, our curiosity. Here you will find: discussions, reviews, interviews, paper summaries and so on, principally about bioinformatics.

Who?: 3 people coming from the same Master's degree: Clelia, Katarina and Marco. 

When?: The idea started in March 2019. Each of us is busy with our own thesis projects, and with more important things to do.

Why?: Why not!?
